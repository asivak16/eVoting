# eVoting System

This project implements a simple voting system using the Paillier cryptosystem for secure vote encryption and tallying. It consists of three main scripts:

1. `keygen.py` - Generates public and private keys for the election.
2. `cast_vote.py` - Allows voters to cast their votes.
3. `tally_vote.py` - Tallies the votes and provides the election results.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `gmpy2` library (for precise arithmetic)

To install the required library, use:
```sh
pip install gmpy2
